    The type of parsers.

    Each parser is seen as a function taking an input string to a pair between
    the parse result and the rest of the input, if the parsing succeeds, or
    to @Nothing@, if the parsing fails. The function type is wrapped into a
    @newtype@ declaration, for implementation hiding. The parser type is
    parametrized over the type of its result, @a@.

        (a -> b) to the parsing context, yielding a function of type
        (Parser a -> Parser b).

        fmap :: (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b

        Intuitively (but not quite correct):

    the result as an @Int@:

    Examples:

{-
    Applicative functors are stronger than general functors, in their ability
    to sequence several computations.

    For example, if we wanted to sequence two digit parsers (above), a first
    attempt using fmap would yield

    (,) <$> digit :: Parser (a -> (Int, a))

    that is, a Parser wrapping a function which we would have no means
    to extract in order to apply it to the result of the second digit parser.

    Applicatives solve this problem, by providing a way to apply a wrapped
    function onto a wrapped argument, yielding a wrapped result (see (<*>)).

    fmap in Functor can be implemented solely in terms of pure and (<*>),
    meaning that any Applicative is also a Functor:

    fmap f x = pure f <*> x
