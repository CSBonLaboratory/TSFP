{-
    The Writer monad is used for logging information during the unfolding
    of a computation.

    Defined in Control.Monad.Writer.
    See https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.1/docs/Control-Monad-Writer-Lazy.html

    The variant in this activity, which is a restricted version of the one found
    in the standard library, uses Strings as log messages. Thus, the suggested
    implementation given below, where a is the result type and the String list
    contains the entire logging history.

    TODO: Replace all the undefined portions below, such that the test run
    for multipleOf3And7 gives the desired output.
